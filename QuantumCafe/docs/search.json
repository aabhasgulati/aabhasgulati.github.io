    "text": "The (one-way) teleportation protocols can be understood as a way to accomplish the communication of unknown quantum states between two parties, which is useful when there are limitations on the parties involved.\nIn this protocol, Alice, sends an unknown quantum state to Bob. The limitation is that she doesn’t have a direct quantum channel to Bob. But she does have access to a (possibly) entangled state which she shares with Bob. And a phone line, which is an euphemism in information theory for a classical communication channel.\nSo how does Alice accomplish the task? Alice can use some pre-shared entanglement, and a classical communication channel to simulate a quantum channel (exactly or approximately). Our goal is to understand these sets of protocols that can be used to simulate quantum channels using resources of (one-way) communication and pre-shared entanglement."
