    "text": "The (one-way) teleportation protocols can be understood as a way to accomplish the communication of unknown quantum states between two parties, which is useful when there are limitations on the parties involved.\nIn this protocol, Alice, sends an unknown quantum state to Bob. The limitation is that she doesn’t have a direct quantum channel to Bob. But she does have access to a (possibly) entangled state which she shares with Bob. And a phone line, which is an euphemism in information theory for a classical communication channel.\nSo how does Alice accomplish the task? Alice can use some pre-shared entanglement, and a classical communication channel to simulate a quantum channel (exactly or approximately). Our goal is to understand these sets of protocols that can be used to simulate quantum channels using resources of (one-way) communication and pre-shared entanglement."

    "text": "This week I will be giving a student journal club talk, and this post is written in the preparation of the talk. The question I will be discussing concerns “When can a state (of a system) be converted into another?”. For this whole article, I would not be defining what a state is very rigourously, but intuitively we all understand that it is some way to describe a system, mathematically.\nThe first situation that we will concern ourselves with is thermodynamics, and the simplest system we can imagine i.e an ideal gas. The state space of an ideal gas is given by \\((U,V) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^2\\), where \\(U\\) is the energy, and \\(V\\) is the volume. The physical operations we can hope to perform on the gas is “heating” or “cooling” it down using some reservoir, or just changing the volume by applying some pressure or reducing pressure. We will assume that its possible to do all transformations sufficiently slowly, so that at every point the gas is at equilibrium with the external pressure, or the external reservoir.\nIs it possible for us to transform the gas from \\((U,V) \\rightarrow (U',V')\\)?"
