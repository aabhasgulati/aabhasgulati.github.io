The limitation is that she doesn’t have a direct quantum channel to Bob. But she does have access to a (possibly) entangled state which she shares with Bob. And a phone line, which is an euphemism in information theory for a classical communication channel.\nSo how does Alice accomplish the task? Alice can use some pre-shared entanglement, and a classical communication channel to simulate a quantum channel (exactly or approximately). Our goal is to understand these sets of protocols that can be used to simulate quantum channels using resources of (one-way) communication and pre-shared entanglement."

    "text": "This week I will be giving a student journal club talk, and this post is written in the preparation of the talk. The question I will be discussing concerns “When can a state (of a system) be converted into another?”. For this whole article, I would not be defining what a state is very rigourously, but intuitively we all understand that it is some way to describe a system, mathematically.\nThe first situation that we will concern ourselves with is thermodynamics, and the simplest system we can imagine i.e an ideal gas. The state space of an ideal gas is given by \\((U,V) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^2\\), where \\(U\\) is the energy, and \\(V\\) is the volume. The physical operations we can hope to perform on the gas is “heating” or “cooling” it down using some reservoir, or just changing the volume by applying some pressure or reducing pressure. We will assume that its possible to do all transformations sufficiently slowly, so that at every point the gas is at equilibrium with the external pressure, or the external reservoir.\nIs it possible for us to transform the gas from \\((U,V) \\rightarrow (U',V')\\)?\nIt is easy to show that by moving in the phase diagram by using the composition of these processes accomplishes the task: 1. Change volume without adding heat to V’. 2. Add or subtract heat (at constant volume) until you get to U’.\nTherefore, we can see that every state can be converted to another using all allowed “thermodynamic operations.” But we can imagine that in some situations due to some constraints, we are not allowed to exchange heat with the system. We call such operations as Adiabatic transformations of the system. How does this restriction affect conversion of states?\nIf you remember your first year thermodynamics, this is exactly a situation in which the second law of thermodynamics applies. We have a closed system, and hence the entropy of the system after the transformation must be either equal to or greater than the entropy before the transformation.\n\\(S(U,V) \\leq S(U',V')\\) if \\((U,V) \\rightarrow (U',V')\\)\nIs this condition sufficient as well? What I mean is that if some pairs \\((U,V)\\) and \\((U',V')\\) satisfy the entropy condition, can we find an adiabatic transformation that connects the two.\nThe answer is yes.\nWe have a complete understanding of state transformations under adiabatic transformations. We represent \\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U',V')\\) if the former can be converted into the latter. We note that the following conditions are true\n\n\\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U,V)\\).\n\\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U',V'), (U',V') \\succcurlyeq (U'',V'') \\implies (U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U'',V'')\\).\nEither \\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U',V')\\) and \\((U',V') \\succcurlyeq (U,V)\\) \\((U,V) = (U',V')\\).\n\nTherefore the relation that we propose completely orders the states of the ideal gas.\nThat’s all we will talk about thermodynamics for now. We look at something which is widely different thing in principle, but allows for similar structures.\nWe consider now a state space of probability distributions on an alphabet \\(\\sigma\\), and the theory of stochastic transformations. To motivate the abstract structure, we will look at the physical situation where such a"

    "title": "Gibbs Paradox and Quantum Mechanics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my third year of undergraduate physics course on statistical mechanics, I encountered a really puzzling issue. I spent a lot of time thinking about the solution, also discussing with few other students. This journey also led to find that this issue did arise more than 150 years ago, almost at the same time when the whole field was being invented. In this post I will dive into the paradox and also its resolution, which is a great testament to the intrinsic beauty of thermodynamics.\nWe have to imagine a rectangular box, with a partition that divides the box into equal volumes, which we will label \\(L\\) (Left) and \\(R\\) (Right). The box is also assumed to have poor conductivity of heat, therefore no heat exchange can take place between inside and outside the box. Then, in the left partition we will fill up an ideal gas which occupies a volume of \\(V/2\\). We wait until the gas reaches equilibrium, and then remove the partition. Our intuition suggests that the gas will expand to fill the complete box.\nAny undergraduate text will tell you that this process leads to an entropy change given by the formula \\[ \\Delta S = nR \\log 2\\] independent of the gas.\nNow you could in principle start with a different situation, and fill both the sides of the partition with the same gas, and the same state, i.e the same pressure, temperature and density. What happens when you remove the partition in this case? There should be absolutely no change in the system, atleast in the macroscopic state of the gas, because it is already an equilibrium situation. We can even verify it explicitly in the diagram.\nWhat’s the entropy change here? Entropy is a state function and since there is no state change, the change in the function should be \\[\\Delta S = 0\\]\nThis seems very reasonable until now. Now here’s the issue. We can also imagine a situation where you fill both the partitions with a different gas. Now as you remove the partition, since the gases do not interact with each other, we can treat it as independent systems. In such a case, the final entropy change should just be\n\\[\\Delta S = n R \\log 2 + n R \\log 2 = 2 n R \\log 2\\]\nNow here’s why this was weird to me at first sight. We don’t specify how different the gases are. It could be a very slight difference in their nature, and not even experimentally detectable. If you are like me, and always imagine a gas as balls bouncing around, the difference of the gases might be that the balls are coloured differently. But let’s say there is a colour-blind person can’t distinguish them apart, so will he ascribe the change of entropy to be \\(0\\) or \\(2 n R \\log 2\\). Yes, most of us are not color-blind but maybe there exists some features of the gas which we cannot “see”? Are we doing thermodynamics wrong then? Or we can’t even do thermodynamics at all?\nThe more learned people will know that this problem is well known as the Mixing Paradox.\nA lot of people assume that the answer to the Mixing Paradox lies in Quantum Mechanics, as there the particles become truly indistinguishable. Two electrons are similar in all respects, there cannot be any more labels that you can attach and no more degrees of freedom. That means that you can only ascribe the \\(\\Delta S = 0\\) when you have two electron gases? But, the inventors of statistical mechanics didn’t know anything much about quantum mechanics. Were they doing thermodynamics wrong?\nTo understand the solution, I had to look around. Finally, and I don’t remember how, I stumbled across the paper on Gibbs Paradox by Jaynes. The resolution of this problem is deeper than what it appears on the surface. It is not just that thermodynamics is a theory that is universally applicable, it is also applicable with partial knowledge of the world."
