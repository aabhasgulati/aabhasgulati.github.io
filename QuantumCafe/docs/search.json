And a phone line, which is an euphemism in information theory for a classical communication channel.\nSo how does Alice accomplish the task? Alice can use some pre-shared entanglement, and a classical communication channel to simulate a quantum channel (exactly or approximately). Our goal is to understand these sets of protocols that can be used to simulate quantum channels using resources of (one-way) communication and pre-shared entanglement."

    "text": "This week I will be giving a student journal club talk, and this post is written in the preparation of the talk. The question I will be discussing concerns “When can a state (of a system) be converted into another?”. For this whole article, I would not be defining what a state is very rigourously, but intuitively we all understand that it is some way to describe a system, mathematically.\nThe first situation that we will concern ourselves with is thermodynamics, and the simplest system we can imagine i.e an ideal gas. The state space of an ideal gas is given by \\((U,V) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^2\\), where \\(U\\) is the energy, and \\(V\\) is the volume. The physical operations we can hope to perform on the gas is “heating” or “cooling” it down using some reservoir, or just changing the volume by applying some pressure or reducing pressure. We will assume that its possible to do all transformations sufficiently slowly, so that at every point the gas is at equilibrium with the external pressure, or the external reservoir.\nIs it possible for us to transform the gas from \\((U,V) \\rightarrow (U',V')\\)?\nIt is easy to show that by moving in the phase diagram by using the composition of these processes accomplishes the task: 1. Change volume without adding heat to V’. 2. Add or subtract heat (at constant volume) until you get to U’.\nTherefore, we can see that every state can be converted to another using all allowed “thermodynamic operations.” But we can imagine that in some situations due to some constraints, we are not allowed to exchange heat with the system. We call such operations as Adiabatic transformations of the system. How does this restriction affect conversion of states?\nIf you remember your first year thermodynamics, this is exactly a situation in which the second law of thermodynamics applies. We have a closed system, and hence the entropy of the system after the transformation must be either equal to or greater than the entropy before the transformation.\n\\(S(U,V) \\leq S(U',V')\\) if \\((U,V) \\rightarrow (U',V')\\)\nIs this condition sufficient as well? What I mean is that if some pairs \\((U,V)\\) and \\((U',V')\\) satisfy the entropy condition, can we find an adiabatic transformation that connects the two.\nThe answer is yes.\nWe have a complete understanding of state transformations under adiabatic transformations. We represent \\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U',V')\\) if the former can be converted into the latter. We note that the following conditions are true\n\n\\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U,V)\\).\n\\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U',V'), (U',V') \\succcurlyeq (U'',V'') \\implies (U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U'',V'')\\).\nEither \\((U,V) \\succcurlyeq (U',V')\\) and \\((U',V') \\succcurlyeq (U,V)\\) \\((U,V) = (U',V')\\).\n\nTherefore the relation that we propose completely orders the states of the ideal gas.\nThat’s all we will talk about thermodynamics for now. We look at something which is widely different thing in principle, but allows for similar structures.\nWe consider now a state space of probability distributions on an alphabet \\(\\Xi\\), i.e \\(p_i \\geq 0\\) and \\(\\sum_{i} p_{i \\in \\Xi} = 1\\) and the theory of stochastic transformations. To motivate the abstract structure, we will look at the physical situation where such transformations are natural.\nThese stochastic transformations can be understood as noise models for transmission of bits. In this case, the alphabet is just two element \\(\\Xi = \\{0,1\\}\\) and the stochastic matrix\n\\[\n\\mathsf{P} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\np(0|0) & p(1|0) \\\\\np(0|1) & p(1|1)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nIn general any non-negative matrix with columns that sum to \\(1\\) is called a stochastic matrix. This condition is essential to ensure that the probabilities sum to \\(1\\). So now we have analogous objects to the thermodynamics situation. We have a description of the set of states, i.e probability distributions, and the set of transformations i.e stochastic matrices.\nSo, we ask the same question (again) Is it possible to convert any state \\(p\\) into another state \\(q\\) using all allowed transformations? Consider the stochastic matrix\n\\[X_{q} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nq, q, q \\dots q\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nBy construction, the columns sum to \\(1\\). And multiplying it to the vector \\(p\\) we get \\(X_{q} \\cdot p = q \\sum_{x} p_{x} = q\\). This achieves our desired transformation. Obviously, we are not looking here for a universal transformation for every \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). That cannot exist. But we have some transformation that does the job!\nAmazing! Now, we want to look at some restricted transformations in this context. A natural restriction that you can impose on these transformations are that they preserve the maximally mixed state, which is the state\n\\[\\mathbb{I}_{d} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{d} \\frac{1}{d}... \\frac{1}{d}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\] This is the most uniform probability distribution you could expect. We will be looking at transformations that preserve this!\n\\[S \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_d = \\mathbb{I}_{d}\\]Clearly we cannot hope accomplish all possible transformations now (because \\(\\mathbb{I}_{d} \\rightarrow\\) anything not itself is impossible). But what are the restrictions? We need not worry, as more intelligent people asked this question long ago, and there is an elegant theory behind this.\nThis is the story of majorisation. And we need to get into some definitions.\nFor every vector \\(x\\) we can define the vector \\(x^{\\downarrow}\\) which is the entries of the vector arranged in decreasing order.\nThen a vector \\(p\\) is said to majorise another vector \\(q\\) if \\(p^{\\downarrow}\\) and \\(q^{\\downarrow}\\) satisfy the following relation\n\\[ \\sum_{i} p^{\\downarrow}_{i} \\geq  \\sum_{i} q^{\\downarrow}_{i}\\]\nFor this, we usually denote it as \\(p \\succ q\\). Let us now state a few trivial propositions,\n\n\\(\\delta_{k} \\succ p\\) for all probability distributions.\n\\(p \\succ \\mathbb{I}_{d}\\) for all probability distributions.\n\nSo intuitively this order tells us about how mixed a probability distribution is. There is something more interesting to note about this \\(\\succ\\) thingy. There can exist two vectors \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) such that none of them majorises the other!\nSo why have we been discussing this (seemingly obsure) construction? Because that is exactly what characterises the transformations possible with doubly stochastic matrices.\nIt is possible to transform a probability distribution from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) using \\(\\mathsf{DS}\\) transformations if and only if \\(p \\succ q\\) !\nThis ends the tale of convertibility in doubly stochastic processes. So we have seen two examples, one physical, and one pretty much mathematical. This leads us to the final example in the theory of entanglement in quantum information theory.\nShould I motivate entanglement here? I think it is a big enough topic for another blog post where I explain and motivate what questions in quantum information and entanglement, that plays an essential role in the whole field, and pops up everywhere.\nStates in quantum theory are given by \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) that are vectors in a Hilbert space. When we have two systems, we have states in \\(H_{a} \\otimes H_{b}\\). As you know this contains states of the form \\(\\ket{\\psi_{1}} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_{2}}\\) but also contains all linear combinations of such states. Some of these are not of the form of a product, and these states are referred as entangled.\nWhat about processes (or transformations)? If you know a bit of quantum theory, you know that we can imagine doing three things, - Apply a unitary transformation - Add some more systems in the mix. - OR Measure. Given any two states \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\), possibly both entangled, we can always design a process to convert from \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) to \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) by a unitary transformation.\n\\[U = \\ketbra{\\psi}{\\phi} + \\text{something orthogonal}\\] Again, we need to talk about imposing some restrictions on these processes. From a practical standpoint, we can imagine how a quantum experiment on “entangled” particles might run.\n\nThere are two labs. Alice, and Bob are the head of the labs, and have almost perfected running quantum experiments in their own labs. But it is impossible with the current technology to send quantum particles between labs, as they suffer from decoherence (losses to quantum properties). But they have a very good internet connection that can transmit classical information. What transformations can they achieve?"

    "title": "Gibbs Paradox and Quantum Mechanics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my third year of undergraduate physics course on statistical mechanics, I encountered a really puzzling issue. I spent a lot of time thinking about the solution, also discussing with few other students. This journey also led to find that this issue did arise more than 150 years ago, almost at the same time when the whole field was being invented. In this post I will dive into the paradox and also its resolution, which is a great testament to the intrinsic beauty of thermodynamics.\nWe have to imagine a rectangular box, with a partition that divides the box into equal volumes, which we will label \\(L\\) (Left) and \\(R\\) (Right). The box is also assumed to have poor conductivity of heat, therefore no heat exchange can take place between inside and outside the box. Then, in the left partition we will fill up an ideal gas which occupies a volume of \\(V/2\\). We wait until the gas reaches equilibrium, and then remove the partition. Our intuition suggests that the gas will expand to fill the complete box.\nAny undergraduate text will tell you that this process leads to an entropy change given by the formula \\[ \\Delta S = nR \\log 2\\] independent of the gas.\nNow you could in principle start with a different situation, and fill both the sides of the partition with the same gas, and the same state, i.e the same pressure, temperature and density. What happens when you remove the partition in this case? There should be absolutely no change in the system, atleast in the macroscopic state of the gas, because it is already an equilibrium situation. We can even verify it explicitly in the diagram.\nWhat’s the entropy change here? Entropy is a state function and since there is no state change, the change in the function should be \\[\\Delta S = 0\\]\nThis seems very reasonable until now. Now here’s the issue. We can also imagine a situation where you fill both the partitions with a different gas. Now as you remove the partition, since the gases do not interact with each other, we can treat it as independent systems. In such a case, the final entropy change should just be\n\\[\\Delta S = n R \\log 2 + n R \\log 2 = 2 n R \\log 2\\]\nNow here’s why this was weird to me at first sight. We don’t specify how different the gases are. It could be a very slight difference in their nature, and not even experimentally detectable. If you are like me, and always imagine a gas as balls bouncing around, the difference of the gases might be that the balls are coloured differently. But let’s say there is a colour-blind person can’t distinguish them apart, so will he ascribe the change of entropy to be \\(0\\) or \\(2 n R \\log 2\\). Yes, most of us are not color-blind but maybe there exists some features of the gas which we cannot “see”? Are we doing thermodynamics wrong then? Or we can’t even do thermodynamics at all?\nThe more learned people will know that this problem is well known as the Mixing Paradox.\nA lot of people assume that the answer to the Mixing Paradox lies in Quantum Mechanics, as there the particles become truly indistinguishable. Two electrons are similar in all respects, there cannot be any more labels that you can attach and no more degrees of freedom. That means that you can only ascribe the \\(\\Delta S = 0\\) when you have two electron gases? But, the inventors of statistical mechanics didn’t know anything much about quantum mechanics. Were they doing thermodynamics wrong?\nTo understand the solution, I had to look around. Finally, and I don’t remember how, I stumbled across the paper on Gibbs Paradox by Jaynes. The resolution of this problem is deeper than what it appears on the surface. It is not just that thermodynamics is a theory that is universally applicable, it is also applicable with partial knowledge of the world."
