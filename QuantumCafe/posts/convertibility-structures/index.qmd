This week I will be giving a student journal club talk, and this post is written in the preparation of the talk. The question I will be discussing concerns "When can a state (of a system) be converted into another?". For this whole article, I would not be defining what a *state* is very rigourously, but intuitively we all understand that it is some way to describe a system, mathematically. 


The first situation that we will concern ourselves with is **thermodynamics**, and the simplest system we can imagine i.e an ideal gas. The state space of an ideal gas is given by $(U,V) \in \mathbb{R}_+^2$, where $U$ is the energy, and $V$ is the volume. The physical operations we can hope to perform on the gas is "heating" or "cooling" it down using some reservoir, or just changing the volume by applying some pressure or reducing pressure. We will assume that its possible to do all transformations sufficiently slowly, so that at every point the gas is at equilibrium with the external pressure, or the external reservoir. 

Is it possible for us to transform the gas from $(U,V) \rightarrow (U',V')$?
