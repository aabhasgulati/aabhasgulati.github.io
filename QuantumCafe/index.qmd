I am a PhD student in the [TIQTOQS](https://quantum-information-open-quantum-system.pages.math.cnrs.fr/) team in Toulouse. 

My PhD supervisors are [Ion Nechita](https://ion.nechita.net/) and [Clement Pellegrini](https://ion.nechita.net/).

# Research Interests 

My thesis work lies in the intersection of 

- Entanglement 
- Symmetry in quantum states 
- Polynomial Optimization

In general, I am interested in Quantum Information. In particular I like 

- Entanglement theory (Bound Entanglement, Schmidt Numbers, Resource theory of Entanglement)
- Quantum Shannon theory
- problems with Tensors and/or Graphs
