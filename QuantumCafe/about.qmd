I am a first year PhD student in 
[TIQTOQS](https://quantum-information-open-quantum-system.pages.math.cnrs.fr/) group at Toulouse, and broadly working on understanding symmetric multipartite tensors, and entanglement theory. I am also interested in Quantum Foundations, Dynamics, and Resource theories. I started this blog to document what I actually know about all this, and hopefully it is useful to other people who also are struggling to understand the same topics.
